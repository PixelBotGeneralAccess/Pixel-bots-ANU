We have weekly team meetings dedicated to work on the project including both code and course assessment.

### EFFECTIVE AND APPROPRIATE DECISION MAKING
After the Week 3 audit, we created a decision paper document, which encompasses all the decisions that have been made since Week 1 of Semester 2. This was highlighted in the Week 6 Audit. Since then, this document has been updated and contains the decisions made by the team organised by weeks in which they were made. It indicates what decisions were made, when they were made and why they were made.
