## Background & Questacon's Vision
Questacon is The National Science and Technology Centre located in Canberra, Australia. The facility, administered within the Australian Government's Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, is home to a range of innovative exhibits, shows, and activities designed appealing to people of all ages.

Questacon seeks to promote awareness and interests in science and technology within the community. We are providing a system that uses robotics to create compelling visual displays for Questacon's audience to engage with.


## Introduction
The project is to build an interactive picture drawing display for Questacon’s upcoming AI and Robotics exhibit. This will be done to highlight and emphasize swarm mechanics to an audience. The way that this exhibit will adhere to Questacon’s educational values will be by creating a picture made up of bots in front of the user, based on a picture drawn by the user. The pattern can be multi-coloured with a pixel art style. Once completed we hope to create an effect that could almost be considered ‘the picture coming to life’, due to the fast movement required to assemble the picture. With these features combined, it will create a fun and interactive display for people to use and enjoy.

## Team Members and Communications
| Name       |       Role     | Description  |
| ---------------|-------------| --------------|
| Boyi Chen     |Integration Lead/Liaison Officer  | Overseas the project management exchanges information between two teams of the project; liaise with output team|
| Ethan Stanbury      | Software Lead     |Overseas the software development and provides technical supports for the team|

|Mischa Rippon|App Developer| Develops an Android app for client|
|Daniel Jang| Software Assistant| Assist and provide his technical expertise with the creation of the software|


Our team uses Discord, Slack and Facebook Messenger for communication, and uses GitHub to store our software solutions. Most of our communications relating to the project is done through Slack, but Facebook Messenger serves as a good second alternative in case team members are unable to be reached via Slack. We have at least one team meetings every week to discuss and work on the project and to ensure we are fulfiling course requirements. We will use GitHub to work on our software, as GitHub provides great tools to aid the software development (such as issue tracking and commit history).

We use email as our communication method with the Client representative.

## Deliverables
Four main deliverables are identified in our project:
[<img src="images/demo_thumbnail.png" width="180" align="right">](https://youtu.be/Gy15_G98JtM)
1. **User Interface** that allows users to draw shapes by coloring the pixels and can run on Samsung tablet provided by client;
2. **Path finding algorithm** that plans and controls movements of the robot based on input to the App;
3. **Relevant documentations** with system analysis and requirement definitions to support all decisions made;
4. **Handover document** includes sufficient information and details for the future project group.
