## Introduction



## TEAM MEMBERS AND COMMUNICATIONS
1. **Boyi Chen** - *Project Manager*
2. **Ethan Stanbury** 
3. **Yuge Shi**
4. **Mischa Rippon**
5. **Daniel Jang**

Our team uses Slack and Facebook Messenger for communication, and uses GitHub to store our software solutions. Most of our communications relating to the project is done through Slack, but Facebook Messenger serves as a good second alternative in case team members are unable to be reached via Slack. We have at least one team meetings every week to discuss and work on the project and to ensure we are fulfiling course requirements. We will use GitHub to work on our software, as GitHub provides great tools to aid the software development (such as issue tracking and commit history).

### EFFECTIVE AND APPROPRIATE DECISION MAKING
After the Week 3 audit, we created a decision paper document, which encompasses all the decisions that have been made since Week 1 of Semester 2. This was highlighted in the Week 6 Audit. Since then, this document has been updated and contains the decisions made by the team organised by weeks in which they were made. It indicates what decisions were made, when they were made and why they were made. The decision log can be found here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XtujnVUvyAoELIFgfqHR2vYqOldP2CBT82ymI5FR2tA">Decision Paper</a>
