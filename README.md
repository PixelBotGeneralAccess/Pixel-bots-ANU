## PROJECT AUDIT REQUIREMENTS
### VALUE DELIVERED TO OUR CLIENT SINCE THE LAST PROJECT AUDIT
Since the last project audit in Week 6, the team has progressed towards delivering the project requirements. The requirements document can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qKgYfd_GCYSdkY3e44BlUMY-dMn5Dcj8wFL-oyatUzU 

* The platform can now match mentees and mentors so that mentors can have multiple mentees. Completing the pairing feature means that the client is now able to provide the mentoring service through the platform.
* Admins can now upload weekly/fortnightly content to mentors and mentees based on gender equity topics and general university support. 
* Admins can now edit the digest page, which contains a summary of that particular fortnight’s theme.
* Admins can now post news and events through a Django App called Blog. This lets them enter a title, a description and a picture, which can be posted to mentees and mentors. 
* Fifty50’s social media feeds such as Facebook and Twitter have been added to the digest page and the news and events page.
* A settings page has been created so that users can update their profile details at any time. 
* The feedback form has now been moved to the profile page so that users can give feedback to admins every week or fortnight. 
* The team has fixed frontend issues including JavaScript errors. 
* The site has been made mobile compatible by adding more styling to the mobile version. 
* The team has completed the project poster, which was displayed at the showcase in Week 10. A PDF version of the poster can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw7MUyh12MoYVDNnWVN6cXgzTkk 
* The site has been deployed now. The link is http://fifty50mentoring.pythonanywhere.com/ 

### EFFECTIVE AND APPROPRIATE DECISION MAKING
After the Week 3 audit, we created a decision paper document, which encompasses all the decisions that have been made since Week 1 of Semester 2. This was highlighted in the Week 6 Audit. Since then, this document has been updated and contains the decisions made by the team organised by weeks in which they were made. It indicates what decisions were made, when they were made and why they were made. The decision log can be found here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XtujnVUvyAoELIFgfqHR2vYqOldP2CBT82ymI5FR2tA">Decision Paper</a>

## PROJECT GOVERNANCE
### EVIDENCE OF DECISION MAKING
Evidence of all the decisions that we have made since Week 1 of Semester Two can be found in our decision paper, available at this link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XtujnVUvyAoELIFgfqHR2vYqOldP2CBT82ymI5FR2tA/edit?usp=sharing">Decision Paper</a>.

### ORGANISATION OF THE PROJECT
Noted at the top of this markdown file are the specific roles of our current team members. Each role is either relevant to working on the front-end of our website or the back-end of our website. Team members assign tasks to themselves or are assigned tasks based on their area of knowledge, which can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/Nikita1710/ANUFifty50-Online-Mentoring-Platform/issues">GitHub Issues Log</a>. Administrative tasks are logged in our <a href="https://trello.com/b/l25xR0T2/timeline-semester-2">Trello Board</a>, however, in the past few weeks we have found it easier to keep track of our administrative tasks using the Techlauncher website of what assessment is due. This is a reactionary process which has worked well since we had clear indication of when each assessment was due, allowing us to start early. 

After our last audit we began using a Google Chrome Extension called ZenHub which allowed us to enable the KANBAN agile methodology to GitHub. This means that we now have a “board” that supports the KANBAN model! If you would like to see our board, download and enable the extension <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd">here</a>. Then go to our GitHub Repository and click on Board or use this link: <a href="https://github.com/Nikita1710/ANUFifty50-Online-Mentoring-Platform/issues#boards?repos=96168761">GitHub Board</a>.

Since we are using ZenHub for issue progress tracking, we don’t use Trello as much and combine the administrative tasks into ZenHub as well. The benefits we have found by using a KANBAN agile methodology is:
* You can visualize the workflow
* It allows us to be responsive to changes.


### TRACEABILITY OF ACTIONS
Every task that is created has a trace of who has worked on it. When committing our code, we add “#[Issue Number]” to our commit message so that GitHub can recognise it and add it to the respective issue. Each action that is performed on an issue, like adding it to a milestone, changing assignees or closing or opening the issue is logged by GitHub. You can find our github issue log here: <a href="https://github.com/Nikita1710/ANUFifty50-Online-Mentoring-Platform/issues">GitHub Issues Log</a>


## PROJECT OUTPUTS
### TECHNICAL DEPTH OF OUTPUTS
Django encompasses a lot of functionality, however it takes some time to develop when you are using external email addresses to enable Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Over the past few weeks we have been working on SMTP, trying to send out emails to the Fifty50 Mentoring email with assistance from contributors. 
<p>
Developing a system to enable mentors to request a maximum of three mentees or less was a difficult task as we had to deal with different Django Apps and files, while sending information from one file to another within the framework.
<p>
Overwriting previous data from the database was an interesting issue we found because we wanted mentees and mentors to be able to edit the personal information. This meant we had to grab the ‘changed’ information from the html page, pass it into the Django framework for it to then update the database. 
<p>
Combining Javascript and Django Template Tags was a struggle as the tabs on our Content pages are procedurally generated depending on how many content posts an admin makes on the backend in either mentee or mentor.
  
### TECHNICAL BREADTH OF OUTPUTS
Since the last audit, there have been a few modifications that show technical breadth of the outputs. We have been working heavily on making the website more maintenance friendly. This means that the web-pages that were static during our last audit have now been made dynamic within the Django framework. Each of the separate pages have their own app which we have worked on and now admins can create content or blog posts when they want to. Manual pairing was updated to include the requirement of mentors only having a maximum of three mentees or less.The database was converted from SQLite to MySQL. There were several attempts to improve the mobile-compatibility of the website. This is still ongoing, and has improved the technical breadth by catering for a multitude of platforms. In addition, the front page now has an embedded Facebook and Twitter news feed, with live updates from the ANUFifty50 pages. The Twitter feed is also contained in the blog page.
<p>
One contributor developed a useful app that collated our feedback and saved it in our database as well as sending an email out of when the feedback was completed to the Fifty50 Mentoring email. Our Github Board was updated at least every day if not every 2-3 days when either new issues were getting added or issues were being completed. Making sure that we managed our issues depending on their priority and in relation to project or assessment work took a bit of effort as we had to complete as much as we could by the project showcase. However, creating milestones to make sure we were on track helped us out. 


### APPROPRIATENESS OF OUTPUTS
The outputs we have worked on and delivered since our last audit have been targeted towards our Project Showcase milestone which can be found at this link: <a href="https://github.com/Nikita1710/ANUFifty50-Online-Mentoring-Platform/milestone/1?closed=1&page=1">Project Showcase</a>. It addresses the requirements outlined in the requirements document and our client is pleased with what the platform can do. 

## PROJECT APPROACH
### DEVELOPMENT APPROACH
The development approach being taken by the team has been BAU (Business As Usual). In our team meetings, we work on Github issues and also discuss any problems that we might be having and seek help from our tutor. During the week, we work separately on our issues and report these to the rest of the team at the end of the week. After migrating to Zenhub from Trello, the issues have been more organised since they have a label indicating which aspect of the project they belong to and also a milestone, which indicates the deadline by which they need to be completed. 

Before starting to work on an issue, team members assign themselves to it and move the issue card to the “In Progress” pipeline. Once they finish working on the issue, they test the code out themselves to make sure that everything that was working before the issue works after completing it as well. After pushing their code to the Development branch, they move the issue card to “Review/QA” so that other team members can review their work and once everything is tested, the issue can be closed. All the work is done on the Development branch and once it is reviewed, it is pushed to the master branch. 

Since opening our project to the wider community, we now have a bit more time, which allows us to offer them tasks in which they can work on and we can learn from what they have done. During each team meeting we will now review all pull requests before we move on, so that we can then update our contributors.

### ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS
Since the Week 6 Project Audit, we have met up with our client, Allissa four times. The dates of these meetings and their agendas can be found below. In addition to this, we have also updated our client using the #client_communication channel on Slack and via personal messages. In our most recent client meeting on the 15th of October, we discussed with her exactly what will be happening in the next few weeks, a list of documents that will be produced for the handover, the date of the handover and what course assessment we have got left to finish before the end of the semester. Our client meeting notes can be found in this folder:  https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1esrEn1yXSeSF93ODJOV2I3bTA

During the break, we held a training sessions for the Fifty50 Committee where we ran through the functionality of the website and steps on how they can do specific actions like adding or deleting user accounts. For the members that couldn't make it to the meeting, Nikita ran through the slides with them and guided them throught the website, later that week. Documentation for the committee training session can be found below:

### PROFESSIONAL TEAM ATTITUTDE
As a team we do our best to maintain a professional attitude with our client, tutor and with each other. We have a client meeting at least once a week or once a fortnight in which we update our client on our current progress and our next steps. We keep in contact with our open source contributors at least once every 2-3 days to make sure that we know what they are working on and if they needed any help. All team members have arrived to meetings on time or have given adequate notice if they are unable to attend, in which case, we sometimes call them via Skype. We decide the time for our team meetings via a Doodle Poll or Slack. 

### TEAM COLLABORATION
Our team collaborates via Slack and Github. We mainly communicate via Slack and also update each other about the project progress by posting issues on Github. We have weekly team meetings dedicated to work on the project including both code and course assessment. In addition to this, everyone tries to complete the issues logged on GitHub and has a good track of committing on GitHub.

Since the Week 6 Audit, we have had 9 team meetings, the details of which can be found below:
